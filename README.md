Projects that I have worked on inlcude:
- Space Station Project (I personalized this project and made my own project which I turned into a sneaker sales site.
- Movie Theatre Site
- Portfolio Project
- Many assignments and challenges

Space Station Project (Sneaker Store):
- I used HTML and CSS for this project and created a website where, hypothetically, people could browse the inventory of sneakers and make orders. This was a fun project to work on and includes a navbar, and image container, and a form.

Movie Theatre Project:
- This was another fun project to work on where I utiltized HTML and CSS. I worked on this site while utilizing Bootstrap which was very cool and where I really started to see how coding can be like figuring out a puzzle.

Portfolio Project (HTML & CSS):
- I utilized HTML & CSS to show my work from this course.
